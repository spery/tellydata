      "description": "  \"Merry Christmas, Festivarians!\" That's how Chris Thile greeted the crowd last year as he opened the Festival. It's long been claimed that Telluride Bluegrass is its own genre, but it took Chris to assign official holiday status to the Fest. Makes sense. TBF comes but once a year, brings tidings of wonder and joy, and is steeped in heartwarming festive traditions.\n\n  Chris is the jolly magical being who comes around each year, bearing musical gifts and surprises for Festivarians from ages one to 92. He has brought joy to the TBF world since he was 12 years old-in Nickel Creek and Punch Brothers, in duets with Bela Fleck and Edgar Meyer, and alone on stage in the prestigious Fest-opening slot, which he's occupied for four of the last five years.\n\n  Last year, Chris delivered his typical spellbinding virtuosity: a Bach partita, a Radiohead cover, an original song about his baby boy, a Paul Simon nugget, a bluegrass ripper, a mandolin ditty about playing the mandolin, and on. Throughout, he mad spirits bright, laughing all the way.\n\n  In October, Chris took over as the new host of 'A Prairie Home Companion,' lending his wondrous intelligence, humor, and musicality to that franchise. But Chris will be home in Telluride for what he calls Christmas. It's the most wonderful Thile of the year. Chris time's a-comin'. Be there with bells on.",

      "name": "Freddy & Francine",
      "description": "  Harmony. We could use a little more of it these days. And the box canyon is the ideal place for voices and hearts to come together. In fact, men and women braiding their voices in musical duets have long made for some of Telluride's most powerful aural sacraments, including recent TBF performances by Dave Rawlings and Gillian Welch, Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell, Robert Plant and Patty Griffin, and young songbirds in love like Johnnyswim and Mandolin Orange.\n\n  To that tender tradition, we add the soaring soul-roots duo of Lee Ferris and Bianca Caruso, who, in 2008, first collaborated under the moniker Freddy and Francine. By fusing their voices above Ferris's percussive guitar, the pair became sensations on the L.A. scene and released a pair of acclaimed albums before separating in 2010.\n\n  After several years apart-Ferris starred as Carl Perkins on stage in 'Million Dollar Quartet'; Caruso recorded a solo album-the pair have recently experienced a romantic and musical resumption. Our ears are rejoincing. Last year's 'Gung Ho' is the best showcase yet for the couple's mellifluously blended vocal lines, often sounding like a single resonant voice gliding over the group's pristine Americana folk-soul.\n\n  Two born-to-belt-it vocalists. A pile of gorgeous tunes. Opening day of the Festival. That's a recipe for harmony in the valley.",

      "name": "Tim O'Brien Band",
      "description": "  Born and raised in Wheeling, West Virginia, in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, Tim O'Brien soaked up the bluegrass, folk , and country music at the foundation of the American musical heritage. And for nearly 50 years, Tim has kept these art forms alive as our most distinguished steward of the music.\n\n  Tim has spelunked deep into American music's ancestral Celtic and folk traditions and has emerged a legend: from the seminal Hot Rize to his Grammy-winning solo and collaborative albums to his instrumental mastery of all things stringed to his oft-covered songwriting to his edifying, entertaining performances. In addition, Tim has traced the music's evolution forward through rustic reimaginings of everyone from Woody Guthrie to James Brown, including full-album tributes to Bob Dylan and Roger Miller, all with Tim's trademark authority and flair.\n\n  Throughout, Tim has embodied the spirit and musical integrity of Telluride Bluegrass as one of our most beloved figures, and 2017 marks Tim's 41st TBF appearance. And in the spirit of historical reflection, Tim has gone full-circle with the new 'Where the River Meets the Road' songs of his native West Virginia. From the Appalachians to the San Juans: Thursday will bring a special opening-day celebration with Tim O'Brien, an artist as timeless and authentic as the mountains themselves.",

      "description": "  The US highway system spans over 200,000 miles, and Fruition, the magnetic quintet currently lighting up the jamgrass scene, have traveled nearly every one of them on the journey that has led them to their Telluride Bluegrass mainstage debut.\n\n  Fruition's trip started in Portland where the group first connected in 2008 over acoustic picking sessions. As the road took them coast to coast, the band absorbed the nation's bluegrass, soul, country, blues, and folks strains. Fruition fused it all into their own post-grass compositie, a dynamic, heart-baring roots arock that triangulates Jay Cobb Anderson's blazed-out guitar, Mimi Naja's speed-buggy mandolin, and Kellen Asebroek's swamp-fox keys.\n\n  Along with bassist Jeff Leonard and drummer Tyler Thompson, Fruition feature three lead singers whose voices meld beautifully together. And while the band can turn up the guitars with supercharged instrumental range and spark-a-fatty jambition, Fruition remain distinctly tune-driven: 2016's 'Labor of Love' is filled with sugar-shot melodies and mile-high multipart harmonies that suggest an even split between Red Rocks and Big Pink.\n\n  The long road to Telluride for artists and Festivarians alike can be years in the making, full of many twists and challenges along the way. On Thursday afternoon, all of those roads and dreams come to Fruition.",

      "name": "Dierks Bentley\nWith The Travelin' McCourys",
      "description": "  Come a little closer, Festivarians, as TBF '17 makes way for one of music's biggest names: platinum-selling, arena-filling country superstar Dierks Benley. How big? Since his 2001 debut, Beltey has landed 15 #1 singles, 13 Grammy nominations, and last year's ACM award for Vocal Event of the Year. Dierk's last seven studio albums (including last year's Black, his highest-charting album to date) have all reached Billboard's Top Ten across all genres. \n\n  However, while Dierks is the smash-hit country soundtrack of choice for today's tailgates, bonfires, and pontoon boats, Bentley's original passion was the sound of mandolins, banjos, and fiddles. Less bro, more dobro. Indeed, Dierks is the rare contemporary Nashville megastar to cut a full bluegrass record, 2010's Up on the Ridge, backed by all-stars like Punch Brothers and the Travelin' McCourys.\n\n  Ronnie McCoury (mandolin), Rob McCoury (banjo), Jason Carter (fiddle), Alan Bartram (bass), and Cody Kilby (guitar) are the Travelin' McCourys, a band that combines traditional and progressive mastery like none other. This is Del's band in relaxed-fit mode, untucked and untamed, supplying peerless trad-style fleet precision but with the jam-ready chops to unleash wild textural electricity, whether they're playing with Keller Williams, the Allman Brothers, or Phish.\n\n  On Thursday, Bentley takes a break from his current headlining world tour to get back to bluegrass with the McCourys. It's a bucket-list gig for Dierks and an exclusive picking party for the rest of us, a one-time-only meeting in the moutains.",

      "name": "Brandi Carlile",
      "description": "  The last time Brandi Carlile played TBF, she performed with such intensity that she cut her hand from over-vigorous guitar strumming. After her set, the crew mopped up Brandi's blood, sweat, and tears from the stage. She later described it as one of the most passionate shows of her life.\n\n  That's quite a claim for an artist who has been leaving it all on the stage for years. Since her '05 debut, she has been folk-rock's most-consistently powerful voice, and her fist-pumpable songs and heart-engorged performances have won over a legion of Bran-atics. Alonngside twin-titan wingmen Phil and Time Hanseroth, Brandi has induced a steady supply of chills on stage and in the studio, most recently with 2015's Grammy-nominated 'The Firewatchers Daughter.'\n\n  2017 brings a reminder of Brandi's eminence as a songwriter: Cover Stories, a 10th anniversary tribute to Brandi's 'The Story', featuring covers by Adele, Pearl Jam, Dolly Parton, the Avett Brothers, and more. The album's proceeds will benefit War Child, an organization that assists children in war-torn areas of the world. In his forword for Cover Stories, Barack Obama wrote, 'As an artist, Brandi Carlile is using her talent on behalf of the most vulnerable among us, children living in areas of conflict. She reminds us that, together, we can build for our children, a more just, peaceful world.' Brandi's story is filled with passion, beauty, activisim, joy and love. 'So many stories of where I've been/and how I got to where I am.' On Thursday evening, Brandi Carlile adds another chapter to her story...and to yours.",
